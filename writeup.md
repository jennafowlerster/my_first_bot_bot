Bot: 

This campaign finance bot tells user how much money was given towards the Palo Alto city council race from contributors in a given zip code, in the 2014 and 2016 council races. 

A user should type in a zip code as an argument, and the script will return a short message. For example, if the user wanted to know about contributions from donors in Portola Valley, they would input their zip code and the script would return the following.  

“Among donors in: 94028
In 2016, 2700.0 was contributed towards the Palo Alto city council race.
In 2014, 0 was contributed towards the Palo Alto city council race.”

The inspiration for this bot stems from my continued fascination with the Palo Alto city council race. 

Inspiration:  

“Is someone trying to buy Palo Alto?,” reads the first line of a letter written in October by eight former Palo Alto mayors: Betsy Bechtel, Larry Klein, Bern Beecham, Sid Espinosa, Dena Mossar, Leland Levy, Lanie Wheeler and Gail Wooley. 

The letter called out five Palo Alto families who contributed the most toward the 2016 city council race. When the letter was sent, the families had given more than $150,000 to two candidates and one political action committee.

By the end of the race, the 11 candidates vying for four open seats on the city council received more than half a million dollars in political contributions, breaking a record for the amount of money raised in a Palo Alto council race. Nine of the candidates and a political action committee received $543,287 in contributions, more than one-and-a-half times the amount that was raised in the 2014 race. 

“Not only are these contributions shocking and deeply troubling, but checks for $5,000 or more are unexpected in our City Council elections,” the mayors said in the letter. 

The sheer amount of money raised during the election underscored the contentious nature of the race. Among the top contributors -- each of whom gave more than $3,500 toward the race -- those employed by real estate and development companies, along with individuals who listed themselves as retired, contributed the most. They were followed by donors who worked in venture capital and those describing themselves as self-employed. The issue of growth has been a hot topic in Palo Alto and this year's race -- and its donors -- put development at the forefront of the debate. 


Out-of-city contributions:

Not only did residents of Palo Alto feel the need to donate large checks to the candidates’ committees, but sizable donations flowed to the race from contributors residing outside of the city as well. 

Ten days after the election, on November 18th, candidate Liz Kniss received 2,500 in contributions from a Los Angeles based political action committee, the California Real Estate Political Action Committee, or CREPAC. Throughout the 2016 CREPAC, located in Los Angeles’ 90020 zip code, gave 7500 to candidates Liz Kniss, Adrian Fine, and Greg Tanaka. The same zip code contributed 2500 towards Palo Alto’s council race in 2014. 

Residents in Woodside weighed in on the election as well, giving $1,998 in total towards the candidates in the 2016 race, as opposed to zero dollars in 2014. Among those contributors, Anne Keenan, wife of Charles Keenan, gave $999 to Greg Tanaka, just under the amount that requires filing within 24 hours. Charles Keenan is a real estate developer for the Keenan Land 
Company, headquartered in Palo Alto. 

Although simple, a script like this could be a useful way for curious residents to pass in a given zip code in order to trace the influence of non-Palo Alto money in the race.
